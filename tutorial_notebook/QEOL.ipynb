    "\n",
    "The **Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS)** problem is fundamental to many applications, but originated with applications to radar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a radar that monitors airport traffic.  The radar signal sent to detect incoming planes must have as much range as possible to ensure safe approaches are planned well in advance.  The range of a radar signal can be increased by sending a longer pulse.  However, in order to differentiate between multiple objects, pulses need to be short to provide high resolution. So, how do you handle situations where you need both?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is a technique called pulse compression.  The idea is to send a long signal, but vary the phase at regular intervals such that the resolution is increased. Generally, the initial signal will encode a binary sequence of phase shifts, where each interval corresponds to a signal with a 0 or 180 degree phase shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part is selecting an optimal encoding sequence.  When the signal returns, it is fed into a matched filter with the hope that a singular sharp peak will appear, indicating clear detection.  The autocorrelation of the original signal, or how similar the signal is to itself,  determines if a single peak or a messier signal with sidelobes will be detected. A signal should have high autocorrelation when overlayed on top of itself, but low autocorrelation when shifted with a lag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the image below.  The signal on the left has a crisp single peak while the single on the right produces many undesirable sidelobes which can inhibit clear detection.  \n",

Then, a child is selected by sampling directly from or combining multiple bitstrings from the population.

    "## Building a Quantum Enhanced Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the effectiveness of MTS, it still exhibits exponential scaling  $O(1.34^N)$ behavior and becomes intractable for large $N$.  Quantum computing provides a potential alternative method for solving the LABS problem because the properties of entanglement, interference, and superpositon may allow for a better global search.  Recent demonstrations have even produced evidence that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can be used to reduce the scaling of the LABS problem to $O(1.21^N)$ for $N$ between 28 and 40 with quantum minimum finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, current quantum hardware limitations restrict solution to problems of greater than about $N=20$, meaning that it will be some time before quantum approaches can outperform the classical state of the art. It should also be noted that standard QAOA can struggle with LABS and require many layers to converge the parameters if other tricks are not employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [Scaling advantage with quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search for LABS](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.04553v1) cleverly explored an alternate path that combines quantum and classical approaches and might be able to provide a more near-term benefit.  Instead of expecting the quantum computer to solve the problem entirely, they asked how a quantum approach might enhance MTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that a quantum optimization routine could run first and the resulting state be sampled to produce a better population for MTS. Many such heuristics for defining the initial population are possible, but the rest of this notebook will explore their methodology, help you to build the workflow yourself, and allow you to analyze the benefits of their approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of quantum enhanced MTS (QE-MTS) is to prepare a circuit with CUDA-Q that approximates the ground state of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the LABS problem. You could do this with any optimization algorithm such as QAOA or using an adiabatic approach.  (See the [Quantum Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/blob/main/quantum-applications-to-finance/03_qchop.ipynb) CUDA-Q Academic lab for a detailed comparison of these two common approaches.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of this work opted for an adiabatic approach (More on why later). Recall that the goal of an adiabatic optimization is to begin with a Hamiltonian that has an easily prepared ground state ($H_i$). Then, the adiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{ad}$ can be constructed as $H_{ad}(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)H_i +\\lambda H_f $, where $\\lambda$ is a function of time and $H_f$ is the Hamiltonian representing a qubit encoding of the LABS problem. \n",

The figure below demonstrates the benefit of using a CD correction.\n",

    "The results clearly show that a population sampled from CUDA-Q results in an improved distribution and a lower energy final result. This is exactly the goal of quantum enhanced optimization.  To not necessarily solve the problem, but improve the effectiveness of state-of-the-art classical approaches. \n",

It is quite likely that other classical or quantum heuristics could be used to produce an initial population that might even beat the counteradiabatic method you used, so we cannot make any claims that this is the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the point of the counteradiabatic approach derived in the paper is that it is more efficient in terms of two-qubit gates relative to QAOA. The benefits of this regime would only truly come into play in a setting (e.g. larger problem instance) where it is too difficult to produce a good initial population with any know classical heuristic, and the counteradiabatic approach is more efficiently run on a QPU compared to alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also note that we are comparing a single sample of each approach.  Maybe the quantum sample got lucky or the randomly generated population was unlucky and a more rigorous comparison would need to repeat the analysis many times to draw any confidently conclusions.  \n",

    "The authors computed replicate median (median of solving the problem repeated with same setup) time to solutions (excluding time to sample from QPU) for problem sizes $N=27$ to $N=37$. Two interesting conclusions can be drawn from this. First, standard memetic tabu search (MTS) is generally faster than quantum enhanced (QE) MTS.  But there are two promising trends. For larger problems, the QE-MTS experiments occasionally have excellent performance with times to solution much smaller than all of the MTS data points.  These outliers indicate there are certain instances where QE-MTS could provide much faster time-to-solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, if a line of best fit is calculated using the median of each set of medians, the slope of the QE-MTS line is smaller than the MTS!  This seems to indicate that QE solution of this problem scales $O(1.24^N)$ which is better than the best known classical heuristic ($O(1.34^N)$) and the best known quantum approach (QAOA - $O(1.46^N)$).\n",

    "The study reinforces the potential of hybrid workflows enhanced by quantum data such that a classical routine is still the primary solver, but quantum computers make it much more effective.  Future work can explore improvements to both the quantum and classical sides, such as including GPU accelerated memetic search on the classical side."
