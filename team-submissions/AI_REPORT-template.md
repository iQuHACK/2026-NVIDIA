> * **Adaptability:** If a specific question doesn't fit your strategy, you may skip or adapt it.
> * **Depth:** You are encouraged to go beyond these examples. If there are other critical technical details relevant to your specific approach, please include them.
> * **Goal:** The objective is to convince the reader that you have employed AI agents in a thoughtful way.

**Required Sections:**

1. **The Workflow:** We used Cursor for coding and debugging with the QAOA/MTS pipeline.
2. **Verification Strategy:** We verified code using a some targeted test cases and solved them by hand to check small N (e.g. N=3) energy values. 
* *Requirement:* You must describe specific **Unit Tests** you wrote to catch AI hallucinations or logic errors.


3. **The "Vibe" Log:**
* *Win:* Debugging
* *Learn:* Dummping all the resources onto cursor
* *Fail:* ZERO!
* *Context Dump:* Share any prompts, `skills.md` files, MCP etc. that demonstrate thoughtful prompting.
